# Simple caculator

##What amazing thing!

I just finished my first caculator that supports evaluates expression with arbitrary length.

This project contains a simple parser, works as syntax analyzer, and duplicate unary plus or minus operators elimination.

Then then evaluator will construct a syntax tree, to make sure which step should be processed in advance.

However, this project only takes my few hours, so it may still remain optimizaiton.

I didn't check memery leak issue, it may cause a colossal breakdown.
